### The different types a user can be
### Currently the user types supported are:
### - user
### - admin
enum: UserType
serialized: byIndex
default: user
values:
  ### These users are sorted with increasing order of permissions
  ### DO NOT CHANGE THIS ORDER WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THIS
  ### For example, if "admin" is placed before "user", then "user" will, by implementation elswhere,
  ### have a higher scope of permissions than "admin"
  ### Be forewarned...
  - user
  - admin
